								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>Severe difficulties with attention, regulation of activity levels, and impulse control have been conceptualised as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (DSM-IV or “hyperkinetic disorder” ICD-10 F90). ADHD is a developmental disorder affecting between 2 and 8% of young people (Russell, Rodgers, Ukoumunne, & FORD, 2014; Visser et al., 2014) that persists into adulthood in around half of the cases (Kessler et al., 2006). ADHD is associated with poor progress in school, lower career prospects later in life, negative effects on the mental health of affected youth and their parents, and even high rates of delinquency and substance abuse (Barkley, 2002). Considerable strides have been made in understanding the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms of ADHD over the last decades. However, these genetic and neurocognitive factors are difficult to target resulting in the currently very limited number of treatment options (Verkuijl, Perkins, & Fazel, 2015). In comparison to rectifying neurobiological factors, it would be relatively easy to make adjustments at school and in the workplace through behavioural interventions, awareness training, and policy to match the predispositions of individuals with ADHD. However, this would require a move away from the deficit model towards understanding ADHD as an adaptation to an environment that may be different to typical educational and occupational settings in which individuals with ADHD struggle. However, these adaptations are poorly understood due to a focus on deficits in ADHD. In this study, I will use insights from theoretical neuroscience and behavioural ecology to understand key features of environments in which ADHD traits may be adaptive. <b>The aim of my proposal is to understand how decision tendencies in complex environments relate to ADHD traits and investigate developmental, genetic, and neurocognitive mechanisms associated with these response tendencies.</b></p>
								<p>To understand the response tendencies of individuals, theoretical neuroscience abstracts key aspects of the environment in tasks that can be described through computational models. This makes it possible to gain a detailed insight into the mechanisms that influence responses and makes it possible to evaluate how a detailed model of a participant’s responses performs under many different conditions. For this study, I will use a complex environment inspired by behavioural ecology (Mobbs, Trimmer, Blumstein, & Dayan, 2018). In these complex environments, participants cannot compute an optimal solution and, therefore, rely on simpler heuristics that are likely to reveal their general response tendencies in the real world (Bach & Dayan, 2017). Computational modelling can then be used to adjust the task to match the participant’s response tendencies and then test how participants perform in their optimal environment. <b>The objective of this study is to identify environments that optimally match participants’ response tendencies and relate these tendencies to clinical measures of ADHD traits.</b></p>
